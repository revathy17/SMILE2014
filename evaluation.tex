\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
We use the two metrics defined in \cite{cheng2010you} to evaluate our system \begin{inparaenum}[(1)] \item Accuracy \item Average Error Distance \end{inparaenum}
Accuracy is defined as the number of users identified within 100 miles of their actual location.
Error distance is the distance between the actual location of the user and the estimated location by our algorithm. Average Error Distance is the average of the error distance across all users.

\subsection{Experimental Results}
We evaluated our approach on 594 users with 1000+ tweets each. These users are distributed across United States. Figure X shows the distribution of the users. Using our approach we could locate 30\% of the users within 100 miles of their actual location. Table \ref{table:wikilinks} shows the local words identified using Wikipedia, in the tweets of these users.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{8cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Location}&{\textbf{Wikipedia Links from User Tweets}}\\
\hline
{Portland, Maine}&{Portland Museum of Art; Old Port; Peaks Island; Portland Head Light}\\
\hline
{Las Vegas, Nevada}&{Bellagio (resort and casino); Hard Rock Cafe; Mandalay Bay;Las Vegas Hotel and Casino; Showgirls; McCarran International Airport}\\
\hline
{Detroit}&{Hockeytown; Detroit Red Wings; General Motors; Detroit Yacht Club; Belle Isle Park}\\
